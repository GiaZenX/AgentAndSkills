# Agent Skills

Userwide-installable skills, a global **constitution**, and a **multi-agent role model** for
**GitHub Copilot** and **Claude Code** in VS Code.

Instead of a single assistant, this repo simulates a small software team: you are the **customer**, the
**main agent becomes your Project Manager (PM)** — your only point of contact — and specialized dev roles
(Architect, Backend, Frontend, QA, DevOps) work below it as **stateless subagents**. No matter which tool
you code with, the AI behaves identically.

**Two-tier entry.** A user-wide **global gate** (`CLAUDE.md` / `COPILOT.instructions.md`) drives the
default agent: on your first build/change wish it asks *structured or free*, classifies the effort via the
**team registry**, and **installs the matching team kit locally into the repository** (`./.claude/agents/`,
a local `./CLAUDE.md`, and enforcement hooks). From then on the **main agent itself acts as the PM**,
governed by that local `./CLAUDE.md` — there is **no separate PM subagent** to bypass or forget, and the PM
keeps the full conversation as its memory. The local constitution carries a marker; whenever it is present,
the global gate **hands over to it completely** (every session). An optional **`group-leader`** agent can do
the install explicitly. If you don't want the process, you choose *free* and work without bookkeeping.

Two kits ship today: **`dev-team`** (software/product engineering) and **`research-team`** (research +
experiments with an FZulG R&D-tax-credit documentation layer). The registry maps your intent to the right
one.

Based on [mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills) plus a custom role model and a
global workflow standard.

## Quickstart

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/GiaZenX/AgentAndSkills.git agent-skills
cd agent-skills
.\install.ps1
```

### macOS / Linux

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GiaZenX/AgentAndSkills.git agent-skills
cd agent-skills
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

Restart VS Code afterwards.

### Options

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `-Target both` (default) | Installs for Claude Code **and** Copilot |
| `-Target claude` | Claude Code only (`~/.claude/skills/` + `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`) |
| `-Target copilot` | Copilot only (`~/.copilot/skills/` + VS Code agents + instructions) |
| `-Force` | Overwrites already-installed files |

On Linux/Mac use `--target` and `--force` accordingly.

---

## Parity: Claude Code ↔ Copilot

Both tools are configured identically. The whole workflow lives in the **global instructions** and
therefore applies to **every** agent / default mode — no matter what you code with, the AI behaves the
same:

| Component | Claude Code | Copilot |
|---|---|---|
| Global gate | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | `prompts/COPILOT.instructions.md` (`applyTo: **`) |
| Global entry agent | `~/.claude/agents/group-leader.md` | `prompts/group-leader.agent.md` |
| Team kit staging | `~/.claude/team-kits/<team>/` | `~/.claude/team-kits/<team>/` (shared) |
| Local team (per repo) | `./.claude/agents/*.md` + `./CLAUDE.md` | same `./.claude/agents/*.md` + `./CLAUDE.md` |
| Tool syntax | `AskUserQuestions` | `#tool:vscode_askQuestions` |
| Subagent call | Task tool | `runSubagent` |
| Templates | `~/.claude/team-kits/<team>/templates/project_memory/` | same (shared staging) |
| Skills | `~/.claude/skills/` | `~/.copilot/skills/` |

The local team is installed in **Claude format** (`./.claude/agents/*.md` + root `./CLAUDE.md`), which
**both** VS Code Copilot and Claude Code read — one copy serves both ecosystems.

## How it starts (two-tier flow)

1. **Global gate asks** (non-coercive): on your first build/change wish the global `CLAUDE.md` /
   `COPILOT.instructions.md` asks *structured (PM) or free?*. Choose *free* and you work without
   bookkeeping.
2. **Auto-init:** on *structured*, the default agent classifies your intent via `team-kits/registry.yaml`
   and runs the scaffold script itself — no agent to remember. (You may instead invoke the optional
   `group-leader` agent explicitly.)
3. **Local install:** the kit's specialist agents are copied to `./.claude/agents/`, its constitution to
   `./CLAUDE.md` (with a team **marker**), and its enforcement **hooks** to `./.claude/`. `project_memory/`
   is **not** created yet.
4. **The main agent becomes the PM.** The kit's `.claude/settings.json` sets `agent: project-manager`, so the
   repo's main session agent **is** the PM (`model: opus`, persistent `memory: project`, a preloaded
   `pm-playbook` skill) — one identity, no relay, nothing to bypass. (The first session right after install is
   bridged in-session by the `./CLAUDE.md` marker handover; the `agent` setting takes over from the next
   session.) The PM runs the **startup gate** (creates `project_memory/` from the kit templates, proposes
   preset + specialist models, you confirm, syncs the specialists' frontmatter), then begins the phase model.
   It maintains `project_memory/` itself and delegates only implementation to the stateless specialists.

---

## Multi-agent role model

The workflow lives in each kit's **constitution** (`CLAUDE.md`) and is executed by the **main agent acting
as PM** plus stateless specialist subagents. The PM is the only interface to the user, holds the
conversation as memory, maintains `project_memory/` itself, and delegates only implementation; specialists
return YAML. Roles below are the **`dev-team`**; the **`research-team`** mirrors the same machinery.

### Roles (dev-team)

| Role | File | Job | Talks to user |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Project Manager** | `project-manager` (the repo's session agent — `agent` setting; opus + memory) | Requirements (PRD/CR), `project_memory/` bookkeeping, delegation, merge, user acceptance | **Yes (only one)** |
| **Software Architect** | `software-architect` | System requirements, architecture, ADRs, coding guidelines | No |
| **Backend Developer** | `backend-developer` | Server-side tasks, tests, commits | No |
| **Frontend Developer** | `frontend-developer` | UI tasks, tests, commits | No |
| **Quality Engineer** | `quality-engineer` | Review, tests, Definition of Done, merge gate | No |
| **DevOps Engineer** | `devops-engineer` | CI/CD, pipelines, environments, release | No |

### Roles (research-team)

Same two-tier machinery, research-flavored. Hierarchy: **Research Question (RQ) → Hypothesis (HYP) +
Experiment Design (EXP) → Tasks**; changes go through **Protocol Amendments (PA)**. The PM (lead) is again
the only customer-facing role.

| Role | File | Job |
|---|---|---|
| **Research Lead (PM)** | `project-manager` (the repo's session agent — `agent` setting; opus + memory) | RQs/PAs, `project_memory/` + **FZulG** bookkeeping, delegation, merge, user acceptance |
| **Methodologist** | `methodologist` | Hypotheses, experiment designs, MDRs, research guidelines, FZulG criteria |
| **Researcher** | `researcher` | Runs experiments, collects raw data, analysis code |
| **Data Analyst** | `data-analyst` | Statistics, effect sizes, visualization, interpretation |
| **Reviewer** | `reviewer` | Reproducibility + validity gate, peer review, merge gate |
| **Research Engineer** | `research-engineer` | Data pipelines, environments, dataset versioning |
| **Report Writer** | `report-writer` | Per-experiment HTML reports with offline LaTeX (KaTeX), fixed template |

### Phase model

`0 READ → 0.5 ASSESSMENT (existing repos only) → 1 PM_DISCOVERY → 2 PM_PROPOSAL →
3 USER_APPROVAL → 4 SYSTEM_PLANNING → 5 IMPLEMENTATION → 6 REVIEW → 7 TEST → 8 QA →
9 INTERNAL_ACCEPTANCE + MERGE → 10 USER_ACCEPTANCE`

- **Two-level acceptance:** PM/QA accept internally per branch/task; the **user only accepts per PRD**
  (on `main`, after the internal merge).
- **ASSESSMENT** runs only for existing repos: PM + Architect + QA produce a **gap report** (missing
  tests, guideline gaps, refactoring candidates, tech debt, security) — the user chooses what becomes
  a PRD/CR.

### Artifacts (`project_memory/`)

Structured YAML files in the repo — the **single source of truth**. Each role writes only its own area
(no overwriting); the **PM** creates `project_memory/` on the first run from the kit templates and owns the
requirement/progress bookkeeping itself. **No ad-hoc status/summary/report files** are allowed — findings
go into the predefined YAML (this is also enforced by a hook, see below).

A user-facing **dashboard** (`progress.dashboard.html`) is generated, never hand-edited: the **PM** runs
`generate_dashboard.py`, which reads the requirement/task/CR YAML files, rebuilds the dashboard from a
static shell, archives the previous version under `dashboard_history/`, and lists what changed since the
last run. Bars expand to reveal the items behind each status (id, title, owner, origin, start/end dates).
Running the generator needs PyYAML (`pip install pyyaml`); the generated HTML is dependency-free and opens
by double-click.

### Git, presets & models

- **Branch per PRD** (`feat/PRD-xxx-…`), merge after internal QA, **push only on user confirmation**,
  no force-push, no work on a dirty tree.
- **Team preset** (`solo` | `duo` | `team`) chosen once per project; escalation is user-gated only.
- **Models:** the **PM (session agent) runs on `opus`** (set in the kit's `.claude/settings.json` + the PM's
  agent frontmatter); the **specialists** start on `haiku`, controlled per repo via `project_config.yaml`
  (the PM syncs each specialist's `model:` frontmatter). Dial the PM to `sonnet` in the kit settings if opus
  is too costly. Specialist upgrades only after a user OK (triggers: 2× QA fail or dissatisfaction).

### Memory

- **`project_memory/`** = the project's facts/state (authoritative single source of truth; the PM maintains it).
- **Agent memory** (`memory: project` → `.claude/agent-memory/<role>/MEMORY.md`) — every role keeps reusable
  **craft knowledge** across sessions (preferences, recurring patterns), kept strictly separate from project
  state. This is Claude Code's native persistent-subagent-memory feature.

### Enforcement (hooks)

Because instructions alone get skipped, each kit ships a small **deterministic** layer (Claude Code hooks in
`./.claude/settings.json` + `./.claude/hooks/`, installed by the scaffold):

- **No ad-hoc files** (`guard_no_adhoc`) — blocks writing status/summary/report files outside the allowlist
  (`project_memory/**`, `src/**`, `tests/**`, `docs/**`, configs).
- **No rogue spawns** (`guard_agent_spawn`) — blocks spawning a generic/unnamed agent; only the installed
  specialist roles may be spawned.
- **Commit / merge gate** (`gate_git`) — always blocks force-push; blocks push/merge without a passing QA
  report in the YAML.
- **Auto-dashboard** (`auto_dashboard`) — regenerates `progress.dashboard.html` whenever `project_memory/`
  changed.

The kit's `.claude/settings.json` also sets `agent: project-manager`, `model: opus`, `plansDirectory: ./plans`,
and `permissions` (allow common build commands; deny reading secrets).

### Status line & install backup

- The installer adds a **status line** (`~/.claude/statusline.py`) showing model · context-usage bar · cost ·
  git branch · 5h rate-limit, and **merges** opinionated global defaults into `~/.claude/settings.json`
  (telemetry off, no commit co-author trailer) — **your personal keys are preserved** and the previous file is
  backed up under `~/.claude/backups/`.
- Both the installer and the scaffold **back up** what they replace before overwriting (with a confirmation
  prompt on install).

### Agent Teams (optional, not default)

This harness uses **subagents** (sequential, dependency-aware, cost-controlled). Claude Code's experimental
**Agent Teams** (parallel teammates that message each other) are *not* enabled by default — our flow is
sequential, where subagents fit better. Enable them yourself (`env: CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`)
for parallel review / competing-hypothesis work if you want.

### Behavior

- **Anti-sycophancy:** never agree silently, justify decisions, push back on the user when needed.
- **The PM speaks plain language** (no jargon); between agents communication is fully technical.

## Recommended workflow

1. **Once per repo:** `/setup-repo`
2. **Before any change:** `/interview` or `/review-plan`
3. **Implementation:** `/tdd` or directly in chat (the workflow applies automatically)
4. **On bugs:** `/debug`
5. **Regularly:** `/refactor`

## Your own fork / customization

To move the repo to a different GitHub account:

```bash
# 1. Create your own empty repo on GitHub (e.g. github.com/your-account/agent-skills)

# 2. Re-point the remote
cd agent-skills
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/your-account/agent-skills.git
git push -u origin main
```

On new machines just clone and run `install.ps1` / `install.sh`.

---

## Update

```powershell
cd ~\agent-skills
git pull
.\install.ps1 -Force
```

```bash
cd ~/agent-skills
git pull
./install.sh --force
```

---

## Uninstall

Delete the folders manually:
- `~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.claude/agents/`, `~/.claude/team-kits/`, `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- `~/.copilot/skills/`
- VS Code prompts folder (see the path table above): the files `group-leader.agent.md` and `COPILOT.instructions.md`
- In each project: the local `./.claude/` (agents, hooks, `settings.json`) and `./CLAUDE.md` (only if you want to remove the team there)
